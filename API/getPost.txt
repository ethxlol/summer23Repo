GET and POST requests can be created in a variety of ways.

We can use fetch() and async/await to asynchronous request data from APIs.

Promises are a type of JavaScript object that represents data that will eventually be returned from a request.

The fetch() function can be used to create requests and will return promises.

We can chain .then() methods to handle promises returned by the fetch() function.

The async keyword is used to create asynchronous functions that will return promises.

The await keyword can only be used with functions declared with the async keyword.

The await keyword suspends the program while waiting for a promise to resolve.

Get requests only request data from other websites, whereas post requests submit data to other sides
