The async function is used to write functions that handle asynchronous actions .


Declarative function wrapped with the async keyword
async function myFunc() {
  function body here
};
 
 Then we invoke this function
myFunc();

we can also write them as expression functions:
const myFunc = async () => {
   Function body here
};
 
myFunc();

async functions always returns a promise 
so we can use .then() .catch() with our async functions 

Undefined will be returned if there is nothing in the function like the examples above 
If there is a non-promise value returned from the function, a promise resolve will be returned to that value 
if a promise is returned from the function, it will return that promise 

async function fivePromise () {
  return 5;
}

fivePromise()
.then(resolvedValue => {
  console.log(resolvedValue);
}) 

the code above will print "5"
