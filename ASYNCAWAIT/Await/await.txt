Async is does nothing without await.

async functions are almost always used with the additional keyword await inside the function body.

The await keyword can only be used inside an async function. await is an operator: 
it returns the resolved value of a promise. 
Since promises resolve in an indeterminate amount of time, await halts, or pauses, the execution of our async function until a given promise is resolved.

In most situations, we’re dealing with promises that were returned from functions. 
Generally, these functions are through a library, and, in this lesson, we’ll be providing them. 
We can await the resolution of the promise it returns inside an async function.
